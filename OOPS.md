OOPS Concepts in Java
The 4 pillars:
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

1️⃣ Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding the internal state of an object and exposing it through controlled methods. In Java, we achieve it using private variables and public getter/setter methods.
Java keywords:
private
public
getters & setters

Q: Why not make variables public?
A: Public variables break data security and allow invalid state changes.

2️⃣ Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and behavior of another class. Inheritance is used for code reusability and to establish an IS-A relationship between classes.
Java keyword
extends

3️⃣ Polymorphism (VERY IMPORTANT)
Polymorphism means one interface, many implementations.
Types in Java
1. Compile-time (Method Overloading)
2. Runtime (Method Overriding)
a) Method Overloading (Compile-time): 
Same method name
Different parameters
Happens at compile time
b) Method Overriding (Runtime polymorphism)
Runtime polymorphism is achieved using method overriding and dynamic method dispatch, where method call is resolved at runtime based on object type.
